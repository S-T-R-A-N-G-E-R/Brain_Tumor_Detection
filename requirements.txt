# Requirements for Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv8 (Streamlit Deployment)
# Optimized for Streamlit Community Cloud (Python 3.13.5, Linux environment)
# Minimal dependencies for Streamlit app with YOLOv8 inference

# Core dependencies
streamlit>=1.39.0  # Streamlit for web app interface
ultralytics>=8.3.182  # YOLOv8 framework
torch>=2.8.0  # PyTorch (CPU support for Linux deployment)
numpy>=1.26.4  # Required by Ultralytics and ONNX
protobuf>=4.25.8  # Required by ONNX
onnxruntime>=1.22.1  # ONNX runtime for inference
pillow>=9.5.0  # For image processing

# Notes:
# - Designed for Streamlit Community Cloud (Python 3.13.5, Linux).
# - Uses ONNX runtime for lightweight CPU-based inference.
# - Install with: `pip install -r requirements.txt` locally for testing.
# - Ensure app.py is the main module and includes Streamlit logic.
# - Model file (best.onnx) must be included in the repository or downloaded in app.py.
# - Large files (BrainTumor/, runs/, *.pt, *.onnx) should be excluded via .gitignore, except for best.onnx if needed.
