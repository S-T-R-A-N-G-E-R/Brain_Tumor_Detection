# Requirements for Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv8
# Optimized for MacBook Air M2 (MPS backend)
# Compatible with Python 3.10 in NNDL Anaconda environment

# Core dependencies
python==3.10.18
ultralytics==8.3.182  # YOLOv8 framework
torch==2.8.0  # PyTorch with MPS support for Apple M2
numpy>=1.26.4  # Required by Ultralytics and ONNX
protobuf>=4.25.8  # Required by ONNX

# ONNX export dependencies
onnx>=1.12.0,<1.18.0  # ONNX model export
onnxslim>=0.1.59  # ONNX model optimization
onnxruntime>=1.22.1  # ONNX runtime for inference

# Additional dependencies for visualizations and utilities
matplotlib>=3.8.0  # For plotting training metrics (confusion matrix, PR curves)
pandas>=2.2.2  # For data handling and analysis
pillow>=9.5.0  # For image processing
pyyaml>=6.0.1  # For parsing data.yaml
requests>=2.31.0  # For downloading pretrained weights
tqdm>=4.66.3  # For progress bars in Ultralytics

# Development tools
jupyter>=1.0.0  # For running training.ipynb
colorama>=0.4.6  # For colored terminal output (onnxslim)
humanfriendly>=10.0  # For coloredlogs (onnxruntime dependency)
coloredlogs>=15.0.1  # For ONNX runtime logging

# Notes:
# - Ensure PyTorch is installed with MPS support for Apple M2.
# - Run `conda create -n NNDL python=3.10` and `conda activate NNDL` before installing.
# - Install with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# - Some packages (e.g., matplotlib, pandas) are implicit in YOLOv8 workflows but included for robustness.
