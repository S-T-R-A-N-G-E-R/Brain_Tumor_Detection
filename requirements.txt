# Requirements for Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv8 (Streamlit Deployment)
# Optimized for Streamlit Community Cloud (Python 3.13.5, Linux environment)
# Compatible with YOLOv8-based brain tumor detection app

# Core dependencies
streamlit>=1.39.0  # Streamlit for web app interface
ultralytics>=8.3.182  # YOLOv8 framework
torch>=2.8.0  # PyTorch (CPU support for Linux deployment)
numpy>=1.26.4  # Required by Ultralytics and ONNX
protobuf>=4.25.8  # Required by ONNX

# ONNX export dependencies
onnx>=1.12.0,<1.18.0  # ONNX model export
onnxslim>=0.1.59  # ONNX model optimization
onnxruntime>=1.22.1  # ONNX runtime for inference

# Additional dependencies for visualizations and utilities
matplotlib>=3.8.0  # For plotting training metrics (confusion matrix, PR curves)
pandas>=2.2.2  # For data handling and analysis
pillow>=9.5.0  # For image processing
pyyaml>=6.0.1  # For parsing data.yaml
requests>=2.31.0  # For downloading pretrained weights
tqdm>=4.66.3  # For progress bars in Ultralytics

# Development tools
jupyter>=1.0.0  # For running training.ipynb (optional for deployment)
colorama>=0.4.6  # For colored terminal output (onnxslim)
humanfriendly>=10.0  # For coloredlogs (onnxruntime dependency)
coloredlogs>=15.0.1  # For ONNX runtime logging

# Notes:
# - Designed for Streamlit Community Cloud (Python 3.13.5, Linux).
# - PyTorch uses CPU backend (no MPS/GPU in Streamlit Cloud).
# - Install with: `pip install -r requirements.txt` locally for testing.
# - Ensure app.py is the main module and includes Streamlit logic.
# - Large files (BrainTumor/, runs/, *.pt, *.onnx) should be excluded via .gitignore.
